*************
Bug-Reporting
*************

Like every other project out, there will occur bugs in openhiven.py. Especially with the pre-releases and development-
changes, which can easily break quickly. Therefore we need everyone who uses openhiven.py reports theses issues
on Github or the Hiven House to fix them later.

To report a bug, please open an issue on the issue page on openhiven.py. To manage the problems better, there exist two types
of issues: bug report issues and feature request issues.

* Bug-Report issues should be used whenever using functionality that is expected to work gives back an unwanted result.

* Feature requests should specifically target the openhiven.py functionality and contain ideas on improving those or adding even more.
  These can also be related to bugs and other issues but should not be only containing bug-related content.

In these issues, please add as much data as possible about the case. That helps the developers know exactly what and
where that issue exists and where the developers should implement that feature. For that, there are also already automatic
fill-out fields in the requests to make the job easier. If you have done that and are finished, wait for a developer or
other users' response and see what they think and what can be done about it. That means patience and also giving back
as much feedback as possible about the topic. So, Thank you if you have already done that or will do that in the future!
