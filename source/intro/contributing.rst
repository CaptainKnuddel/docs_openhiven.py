    Welcome to the Contributing page of Openhiven.py! If you are here to search for options to maybe share your work and
    ideas for Openhiven.py. I and the entire development team is happy to hear that.

    Since Openhiven.py is an "free time" project of Developers, it is heavily dependent on user-feedback,
    bug reports and also contributions of other users, so it can steadily improve and also stays up-to-date, since Hiven
    changes very quickly and therefore openhiven.py needs also to apply to these new changes.

    It is relatively easy to contribute to openhiven.py if you do it the right way. Go to the
    `Github page <https://github.com/FrostbyteSpace/openhiven.py>`_ and look into issues and see what is happening right
    now and what exactly needs work. If you find issues you can also go there and report issues that you found while
    using openhiven.py. This will be explained more in detail in the `bug-report page <https://openhivenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bug_report.html>`_
