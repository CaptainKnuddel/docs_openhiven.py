    Welcome to the Contributing page of openhiven.py! If you are here to search for options to maybe share your work and
    ideas for openhiven.py. I and the entire development team is happy to hear that.

    Since openhiven.py is an "free time" project of Developers, it is heavily dependent on user-feedback,
    bug reports and also contributions of other users, so it can steadily improve and also stays up-to-date, since Hiven
    changes very quickly and therefore openhiven.py needs also to apply to these new changes.

======
Github
======

    It is relatively easy to contribute to openhiven.py if you do it the right way. openhiven.py, in this case,
    uses Github to host it's the repository and manage the project. Therefore contributions need to be made on Github
    since else the Developers and 'Managers' cannot correctly integrate changes without many issues that need to be solved.

    To start, go to the `Github page <https://github.com/FrostbyteSpace/openhiven.py>`_ and look into issues and see
    what is happening right now and what exactly needs work. If you find problems while using openhiven.py, you
    can also discuss issues or share your ideas on new features and improvements.

    .. note::

        More Bug-Reporting details in the `bug-reporting docs-page <https://openhivenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bug_report.html>`_
