Welcome to the Contributing page of Openhiven.py! If you are here to search for options to maybe also
share your work and ideas and maybe even implement functionality into Openhiven.py you are in the right place for that.

Since Openhiven.py is an open-source "free time" project of Developers, it is heavily dependent on user-feedback,
bug reports and also contributions of other users and we want to support that to make Openhiven.py the best it can be.
