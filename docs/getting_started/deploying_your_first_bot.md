# Deploying your first Hiven-Bot

---

!!! Warning

    **This documentation page is not finished yet! Information can be outdated or entirely not available!**


Deploying a Bot is very easy and quick in OpenHiven.py while also very customisable.
With the ability to pass your own EventHandler and also customise handling and connection attributes you have
control on how exactly your Bot should run. Currently, due to the early Development Stage of some features
some might fail when using, if such a thing happens please report these on the Github Page.

## Authentication and Tokens

As already shown in examples on the page [Intro to OpenHiven.py](./intro.html) to use a bot, you need to pass 
a Token to authorise and connect to Hiven. This token is a key to the account that the Client will be
using to interact with the Hiven Platform; therefore, OpenHiven.py cannot run without it, since its 
features depend on such token! Because of that and the risk of other users taking over your account, it is 
crucial to keep such a token save and not share it on any platform! Doing that could risk that your entire 
account getting compromised!
